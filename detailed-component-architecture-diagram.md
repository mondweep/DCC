## Explanation

This diagram illustrates the component architecture of the Decentralized Consulting Collective (DCC) application, highlighting the interactions between the frontend and backend components.

### Frontend Components

*   **CreateProposal:** This component allows users to create new proposals. It interacts with the `Web3Context` to submit the proposal to the `GovernanceContract`.
*   **ProposalList:** This component displays a list of proposals and allows users to vote on them. It interacts with the `Web3Context` to fetch proposals from and submit votes to the `GovernanceContract`.
*   **Web3Context:** This component provides the web3 provider and contract instances to the frontend components. It handles the interaction with the blockchain and manages the user's wallet connection.
*   **App:** The main application component that initializes the `Web3Context` and renders the other frontend components.

### Backend Components

*   **GovernanceContract:** This contract manages the proposals and voting process. It allows users to create proposals, vote on proposals, and execute approved proposals.
*   **MembershipContract:** This contract manages the DCC membership. It allows users to join the DCC and tracks their membership status.
*   **IncomeManagementContract:** This contract manages the income generated by the DCC. It tracks the income and distributes it to the members.
*   **PaymentContract:** This contract manages the payments to consultants. It allows the DCC to pay consultants for their services.

### Key Flows

*   **Creating a proposal:** The `CreateProposal` component calls the `createProposal` function in the `Web3Context`, which then calls the `createProposal` function in the `GovernanceContract`.
*   **Voting on a proposal:** The `ProposalList` component calls the `voteProposal` function in the `Web3Context`, which then calls the `voteProposal` function in the `GovernanceContract`.
*   **Joining the DCC:** The `Web3Context` calls the `joinDCC` function in the `MembershipContract`.
*   **Distributing profits:** The `IncomeManagementContract` calls the `distributeProfits` function in the `PaymentContract` to distribute profits to the members.
*   **Paying consultants:** The `PaymentContract` calls its own `payConsultants` function to pay consultants for their services.
